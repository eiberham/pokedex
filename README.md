## Pokedex.

This is a pokedex built with react leveraging basic hooks functionality and the pokémon api,
for the ui i used flexbox for positioning elements and styled components to give it some 
color.

In addition components lazy load was added through lazy and suspense.

You can see a list of the 151 pokémons available in the api and search any, there's a detail
component where you can see a picture of the pokémon and relevant stats like type and base
experience.

Below you can see a screenshot of the end result:

## How to run it ?

First step, clone the repo.

```console
foo@bar:~$ git clone https://github.com/wwleak/pokedex.git
```

Then run the following command within the project folder to install all the dependecies:

```console
foo@bar:~$ npm install
```

Afterwards run the following command:

```console
foo@bar:~$ npm run start
```

Now if you go on localhost://3000 you should see it.

Enjoy!

## Available Scripts

You can find all available scripts in the package.json file

## Note

It was solely a practice to start learning hooks stuff, i'm currently refactoring the code so some described functionality might not work.
