Podedex.

This is a pokedex built with React leveraging basic hooks functionality and the pokémon api,
for the UI i used flexbox for positioning elements and styled components to give it some 
color.

In addition components lazy load was added through lazy and suspense.

You can see a list of the 151 pokémons available in the api and search any, there's a detail
component where you can see a picture of the pokémon and relevant stats like type and base
experience.

Below you can see a screenshot of the end result.
